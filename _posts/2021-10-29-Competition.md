Introduction

The bubble house consists of a transparent "bubble" and a transparent front porch. People can open the zipper door from the outside to enter the front porch, close the zipper door and then enter the large "bubble" space. The front porch well ensures that the air and temperature in the "bubble" house are not lost. The zipper door can be well connected with bubble PVC, and the connection between "bubble" and the front porch is also through zipper.

Entering the bubble house, the first floor is an open space, 20 square meters. There are two round sofas on the left. Next to the small sofa, you can read and rest. The big round sofa is not only good for us to enjoy the scenery outside, but also good for us to see the projection video. On the right is the open kitchen, and the table next to the kitchen provides a wider view. The toilet is the only closed place on the first floor, located behind the projection.

Then climb the ladder to the second floor. The second floor provides people with a small rest space to study and sleep, with an area of 8 square meters. The second floor has a broader vision and provides a space to enjoy the external environment.

The solar energy nearby provides the main energy, and the blower ensures the indoor air circulation. You can set warm air in winter and cold air in spring.

The main concept of bubble house is to connect nature. The transparent bubble house provides a broader vision, and the open design strengthens the relationship between life and nature.

If you are a person who enjoys nature and life comfort, bubble house is a good choice for you!
