`Appearance`

The outside is a huge transparent "bubble".

The interior is a two-story building.The first floor is open and the second floor is semi open.

`Introduction`

Enter the bubble house through two transparent "bubbles", and the first floor is fully open. On the left is an open rest area where you can watch TV. On the right is the kitchen and dining place. The toilet was changed to the bottom of the stairs. Go up the second floor to the bedroom and climb the stairs to the bed. There is a short flight of stairs opposite the bedroom. You can see the scenery from the balcony.

`Difference from the previous design`

- Open the closed space on the first floor into an open space, and only the toilet is in the closed space below the stairs.

- A broader vision and transparency, closer ties with nature.

- Added furnitures.
