  Mushroom cabin is located in a pine forest. How to deal with the relationship between architecture and nature is the focus of our design.

  The architectural form of mushroom cabin is divided into two simple volumes according to its functions. The main body of the mushroom is the guest room space. A circular full-length window is set near the visual height. When the guests sit on the chair or lean against the bed, they just feel the surrounding green trees and the sunshine from the window. As the parent-child area, the attic on the second floor is reached through small-scale stairs. The small side window of the parent-child area increases the comfort and permeability of the attic area. The inverted conical space with high top is processed into a natural arc, and the pure white dome brings a sense of boundless extension.

  At the same time, the round skylight on the top brings different light and shadow expressions to the bathroom space with the change of time and weather. Different from the usual closed bathroom space design, this light and shadow rich space also has the function of entrance area. It is a place where residents often pass and stay.

  This is a hidden hut built in the mountains. The roads here are mainly country roads. According to the budget and the needs of customers, the designer designed a simple Cabin: a space where two people can eat, sleep and read, and everything else is carried out outdoors. Compared with the surrounding open space, the hut is designed as a shelter regularly connected to the outdoors.

  The entrance floor has a specific height and has a large window to see the activities inside from the outside, while the kitchen and bath are located in the mezzanine. In the middle of the floor plan, there is a steel ladder leading to the attic. From these windows of different sizes, you can have a panoramic view of the surrounding iconic mountains.

  The building shows a feeling of standing out in this steep terrain. Three people soon assembled the cabin, where a simple construction process is necessary.

  In order to avoid the use of chemical products, the pine board used for cladding was charred by traditional process on site. Such a thin layer of treatment can make the cabin last longer and prevent the invasion of bad weather. Indoor plywood panels cover power and water supply pipes, which is also a warm decoration.
