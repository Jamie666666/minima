`House includes`

- Toilet
- Kitchen
- Activity space
- Rest area
- Garden
- Balcony

`Appearance`

The outside is a huge transparent "bubble".

The interior is a two-story circular enclosed space.

`Introduction`

The round shape of the bubble house is reserved, and the first floor is a closed space with kitchen and toilet. The kitchen is designed under the stairs to save space. The second floor is divided into rest and sleeping area and balcony. The rest area has shelves and tables for study, and the other side is a bed. Opposite the rest area is a small balcony, where you can enjoy the external natural scenery.

`Difference from the previous design`

- Turn the closed space into the transparent appearance of the bubble house, strengthen the connection with nature and broaden the field of vision.

- The opening of the building ensures a certain degree of privacy.
