`Appearance`

The outside is a huge transparent "bubble".

The interior is a two-story enclosed space.The shape is geometric.

`Introduction`

Entering the bubble is a transparent place to enjoy the scenery. The first floor is the kitchen and bathroom. The closed space ensures privacy. The kitchen is designed under the stairs to save space. On the second floor is the rest area, and the bed is located above the stairs. There is a small staircase opposite the second floor. Up there is an open balcony where you can enjoy the external natural scenery.

`Difference from the previous design`

- The round building has been changed into a geometric shape, and only right angles can form a contrast with the external "bubble". Highlight the beauty of bubble.

- Lower the space of the toilet, provide more space for the rest space on the second floor, create different floors and increase interest.

- The bed is placed on the stairs to make more space for the rest area.

- The desk is designed outside the building to better enjoy the scenery.

- From two-tier space to four tier space.
