Welcome! I'm Jamie Yuxuan Zhang, a junior majoring in architecture. Here is my design named Bubble House, in 2021 FALL semester.

[Part to Whole - Global to Local](http://keanmgc.github.io/2021fall3yr-studio/)

`Definition of home`
- A space for people to live and rest
- Comfortable
- Can meet some of the most basic functions of life, such as bed, kitchen and bathroom
- Might be closed, because our life needs private space, and the house is the environment that can best reflect our private space
- A place we yearn for, which can bring us a sense of peace and security.


`Client in the home`

Number: 1-2 worker

The house is designed for young workers who are in urgent need of housing and enjoy natural life.


`Material`

[Space Board][9e173dc6]

  [9e173dc6]: https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%AA%E7%A9%BA%E6%9D%BF/1268221 "Space Board"

space board: The artificial light stone prepared by high-strength cement foaming process is used as the core material, and the upper and lower cement surface layers reinforced by glass fiber mesh (or fiber bundle) and steel ribs are combined to form a new light roof plate. It has the characteristics of good stiffness, high strength and good ductility. It has good structural performance and engineering application prospect.
Moreover, it uses new technology to organically combine ordinary cement and industrial waste to realize waste reuse in the concept of environmental protection. The house constructed with this material has high durability.
