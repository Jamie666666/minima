_Introduction_

The bubble house has two transparent bubbles. In order to control the indoor temperature and air flow, first enter the small "bubble", close the zipper door, and then enter the large "bubble" space.
The first floor is an open space. There are two circular sofas on the left, where you can see the projection. Next to the small sofa, you can read and rest. The round sofa is good for us not only to enjoy the scenery outside, but also to see the projection. On the right is the open kitchen, and the table next to the kitchen provides a broader view.
The toilet is the only closed place on the first floor, located below the stairs, saving space.

From the middle staircase to the second floor is a rest space, and the learning table is extended, which is not closed. Here, climbing the stairs is a bed. The bed is directly above the stairs and at the highest point, with a broad view.
A small staircase opposite the rest space is the balcony, on which there is an "L" sofa to provide a space to enjoy the outside environment.

The main concept of bubble house is to connect nature. The transparent bubble house provides a broader vision, and the open design strengthens the relationship between life and nature.
