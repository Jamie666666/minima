`experience`

- In reality, pasting our plan on the ground makes it easier for us to see whether the space collocation is reasonable and let us better understand the size of tiny house.

- Open bubble house does not need redundant walls and windows, because openness and transparency is the main concept.

- More intuitively consider your own material selection and the thickness of the wall.
