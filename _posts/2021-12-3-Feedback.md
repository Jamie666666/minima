`Feedback`

1. "Bubble Restaurant", "Bubble Retail Store", "Bubble Kindergarten" and "Bubble Library" need a meaning. Why are there huge bubbles? What does it have to do with local architecture?

2. The inside of the domes is housing. Has the transparent function of the external bubble been lost - kindergartens and libraries can be more open.

3. Lack of details, add appropriate furniture and pedestrians to the buildings in the animation path.

4. Lack of materials, add building materials, bubble materials and grass on the rendering.
