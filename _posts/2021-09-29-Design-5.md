`Technology`

- Solar Energy 

  Solar energy can provide electric energy for bubble houses. More importantly, bubble houses need continuous power supply and inflation. Solar energy can ensure a continuous and stable energy source.

- Rainwater Collection System

  Rainwater collection system can ensure continuous water supply. When it rains, collect rainwater in the underground water tank. These water can be used in the toilet, filtered and recycled, which solves the water supply of tiny house.

  The water problem was turned into an opportunity by placing circular shaped photovoltaic umbrellas in the rooftop that create nice shaded entertainment areas.

  The roof also functions as a rainwater collection system by draining and storing the rainwater in the basement tanks, which later goes through a filtration process to be reused for building´s toilets and taps.

`Appearance`

The outside is a huge transparent "bubble".

The interior is a two-story building.The first floor is open and the second floor is semi open.

`Introduction`

There is a solar panel at the door, which also acts as a rainwater collector. Enter the bubble house through two transparent "bubbles", and the first floor is fully open. On the left is an open rest area where you can Look at the projector or enjoy the scenery. On the right is the kitchen and dining place. The toilet was changed to the bottom of the stairs. Go up the second floor to the bedroom and climb the stairs to the bed. There is a short flight of stairs opposite the bedroom. You can see the scenery from the balcony.

`Difference from the previous design`

- It changes the appearance of the sofa. The circular sofa echoes the shape of "bubbles" and provides a better opportunity to see the outside.

- Put the wash basin in the toilet so that the space on the left is a rest area.

- The dining table on the right also becomes round, and a sofa is added to the balcony above the dining table. It provides more opportunities to enjoy the external scenery.

- Solar energy system and rainwater collection system are added.
